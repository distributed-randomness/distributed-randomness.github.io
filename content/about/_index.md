I have been designing and writing distributed databases for just under a decade now. This
is just about time to start forming opinions and share them, and hence, this blog.


Ideas and opinions take shape in a context. The context is determined by where someone is
coming from. Therefore, I will explain my experience with the systems very briefly. I have
worked in two database groups in the past 9 years. The first 5 years were spent building
a relational database for analytics on the cloud. I joined this team right out of college.
At that time, the service was only a year old. Therefore, I can claim that I was with the
service, more or less, right from the beginning.


My next experience has been with another analytical database, that specializes in search. Most
of the customers use it for the document search or log analytics. A couple of years in
this team, I proposes a complete rewrite of the system which would make it truly could
native and serverless. The proposal got accepted by the management and I got the funding
to lead the design and implementation of the same. I architected the full data plane and
implemented parts of it.

During all these years, I have learned to build practical systems on the job and have
taught myself to reason about systems more formally in my own time. In this blog I would like to share
some of my thoughts on ***distributed*** systems and other ***randomness***. Along the
way, I will also discuss papers and books. But as with any
blog post, *the opinions are my own* and therefore, take them with a grain of salt. Use the
ideas that you find helpful in your own projects or work, and leave out the rest.

I welcome constructive criticism and therefore, do let me know what you think.
