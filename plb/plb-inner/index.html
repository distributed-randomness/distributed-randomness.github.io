</header><p>We use a distributed storage system when the data is too large to fit in a
single machine or host. The system designer gets around it by partitioning
the data into manageable chunks called shards or partitions. This is where our
problems begin. I will not discuss the schemes to partition data but given
the shards, how we can distribute them among the available hosts. The objective
would be to drive similar utilization among all the hosts.</p>
<p>For example, say, I have 100 hosts upholding my cloud storage service. 2
of them are running at 100% CPU and the rest at 30%. This is a recipe for
disaster. Now I must remedy the situation. The system cannot route any request
to any host. The destination must be the one that has data relevant to the
request. Therefore, one likely reason for this imbalance is that these two
hosts have the most number of shards (skew in shard assignment) or few of the
most requested shards. Therefore, shard placement is the key to driving
uniform utilization. The CPU was an example, the contended resource might be
memory, IO, or other application-specific metrics. Usually, we do not shoot
for perfect equality, but rather an optimum band. This is usually application-dependent but something like 50-70% utilization is good. It has enough headroom
to allow minor peaks while more hosts are added. The other end of the spectrum
is say, all 100 of my servers are running at 10% CPU. This is an opportunity to
reduce the host count without impacting the service quality. This will decrease
the operating cost of the service, which means more profit.</p>
<p>With this background, I will define the problem more concretely.  My intention
is to build a general-purpose service, which is responsible for placement and
load balancing (PLB as a service). To make it a successful service,
I must arrange all the shards in the minimum possible hosts without violating
the hard constraints (like a primary and replica cannot be on the same
host, or/and there should be no more than 1 primary replica of a shard or there
be no more than 3 secondary replicas of a shard) and meeting the provided
goals (like no host to have  CPU utilization greater than 80%, and/or each
a host should have CPU utilization that is no greater or less than the median
CPU utilization across all hosts by 10%, and/ or  the count of the primary replica
should be balanced across all hosts). At its core, this is a [bin-packing]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Bin_packing_problem), [problem](https://
developers.google.com/optimization/ pack/bin_packing). Bin-packing is <code>NP- hard</code> and the decision problem of whether the number of shards can fit in
the specified host is <code>NP-complete</code>. I will define the goal in plain
English but you can refer to the [wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Bin_packing_problem) for a mathematical treatment.</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one host must be used</li>
<li>Along a dimension, the sum of values of all shards placed in a host, is less than
the value of the host. A concrete example can be the sum of CPU required by each
shard placed in a host should not exceed the total CPU available on the host. We
repeat this for all resources we care about like io, network, and the like.</li>
<li>We tack on application-specific goals similarly.</li>
</ul>
<p>If I formulate this as an optimization problem subject to constraint,
then I can use a <a href="https://developers.google.com/optimization/pack/bin_packing">constraint</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/good_lp/latest/good_lp/">solver</a> to find a solution.</p>
<p>A few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The assignment of the shard to the host is dependent on traffic which is time-dependent.
It is advisable to prefer solutions that are quick to compute and advances a few
steps at a time. Solving for the full optimization might take a long time by
which the solution might be irrelevant.</li>
<li>The moves to dissipate heat are not free. They create more churn shortly. This
is expected to stabilize over time.</li>
<li>Instead of solving for full optimality, we can reduce the solution space so that
we reach convergence quicker. We do this by picking the hottest node and the 
largest contributing shard in it, then finding a new host for it. </li>
</ul>
<p>With this background, we are well-placed to solve the problem of shard placement. Before,
we devise our solution, we must look into how others are solving the same.</p>
<h2 id="related-work">Related Work<a class="zola-anchor" href="#related-work" aria-label="Anchor link for: related-work">Â§</a>
</h2>
<p>We will go over some important work done in this space and learn from them.</p>
<h3 id="google-slicer">Google Slicer<a class="zola-anchor" href="#google-slicer" aria-label="Anchor link for: google-slicer">Â§</a>
</h3>
<p>Slicer measures imbalance (ratio
of the max task load to mean load) to trigger remediation and uses the amount of key churn as a
damping factor. Slicer dissipates heat by greedily moving shards off the hot host, adding more
replicas, merging (to drive the utilization up), or splitting shards in a loop until the key
churn budget is hit. Moves have cost on the new node as it has to hydrate the data from somewhere
while serving queries. Slicer tries to not make any moves if the CPU utilization is low.</p>
<p>Slicer takes little to no input from the applications that use this service.
It has quite an opinionated approach to constraints, the notion of imbalance,
and the goals it optimizes for. Slicer does not take into account task
heterogeneity. The paper says that the CPU is a good proxy for it. It also uses
arbitrary constants for what low CPU means and how much more budget to expend.
I am unsure, how much adoption it got since its inception. Slicer most likely does
not consider application-specific metrics for heat balancing as the paper does
not mention it.</p>
<h3 id="microsoft-service-fabric">Microsoft Service Fabric<a class="zola-anchor" href="#microsoft-service-fabric" aria-label="Anchor link for: microsoft-service-fabric">Â§</a>
</h3>
<p>The PLB component of MSF uses system metrics, application metrics, and also per-request peculiarities to balance the load. The service uses simulated annealing to
minimize the total cluster energy, where the energy function is user provided.
The most commonly used function is the average standard deviation of all the
metrics. The load-balancing algorithm starts by setting a timer and generating
a random move. If the new state has lower energy than the current, it makes the
move. If the new state has a higher energy than the current, it jumps with a
probability of $$e^-\frac{T_{new} - T_{current}}{T_{current}}$$.</p>
<p>It uses Simulated Annealing as it is faster compared to other options. The services
is highly configurable and takes inputs from the users.</p>
<h3 id="facebook-shard-manager">Facebook Shard Manager<a class="zola-anchor" href="#facebook-shard-manager" aria-label="Anchor link for: facebook-shard-manager">Â§</a>
</h3>
<p>Facebook has been working on this problem and their PLB service supports the largest
scale and is widely adopted across the company. It uses a general-purpose constraint
solver. The PLB consumes user-provided metrics and goals. Facebook applies domain-specific
heuristics to reduce the search space for the solution by picking the hottest node and the
biggest offender in it and finding it a new home. It also sufficiently prunes the
destination candidates to arrive at the solution quickly.</p>
<h3 id="linkedin-helix">LinkedIn Helix<a class="zola-anchor" href="#linkedin-helix" aria-label="Anchor link for: linkedin-helix">Â§</a>
</h3>
<p>Helix is an open-source project library that solves the same problem. It has a cleanly
segregated constraints module where the valid state transitions of shards and
replicas are modeled and an optimization module. The paper addresses count-based balancing
which tells me there is a hidden assumption that all shards are equal. This assumption
might be a big limitation depending on the usage. </p>
<h2 id="decision-points">Decision Points<a class="zola-anchor" href="#decision-points" aria-label="Anchor link for: decision-points">Â§</a>
</h2>
<p>Before I embark on the journey to build a general-purpose PLB service, I want to go over
some of the learnings based on the survey:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make your users happy. Make it configurable.</li>
<li>Take short and quick steps rather than making big changes.</li>
<li>Take into account the system churn that the new arrangement will bring in additions to the
expected steady state it hopes to achieve.</li>
<li>Don't react too fast. Distinguish between the churn from re-arrangement versus the load
from work-load changes. If the load is from re-arrangement, wait for the dust to settle down.
If the churn is from the workload changes cancel the plan and re-evaluate.</li>
<li>Different actions have different costs. Moving a primary to a new node is costly. See if you
can reduce the churn by flipping the primary/secondary roles. Again, do not hard code these,
make them configurable, use move weights to choose a move.</li>
<li>I want to be able to signal that the overall host count needs to grow or shrink in addition to
rearrangements.</li>
<li>Use a constraint solver. Some tools can solve it generally and efficiently. Otherwise,
over time adding new goals over the existing ones will be difficult and error-prone.</li>
<li>This will be a complicated system. The system should be able to explain why it proposed what
it proposed.</li>
</ul>
