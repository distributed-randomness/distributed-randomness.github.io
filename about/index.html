        </header><p>I have been designing and writing distributed databases for just under a decade now. This
is just about time to start forming opinions and share them, and hence, this blog.</p>
<p>Ideas and opinions take shape in a context. The context is determined by where someone is
coming from. Therefore, I will explain my experience with the systems very briefly. I have
worked in two database groups in the past 9 years. The first 5 years were spent building
a relational database for analytics on the cloud. I joined this team right out of college.
At that time, the service was only a year old. Therefore, I can claim that I was with the
service, more or less, right from the beginning.</p>
<p>My next experience has been with another analytical database, that specializes in search. Most
of the customers use it for the document search or log analytics. A couple of years in
this team, I proposes a complete rewrite of the system which would make it truly could
native and serverless. The proposal got accepted by the management and I got the funding
to lead the design and implementation of the same. I architected the full data plane and
implemented parts of it.</p>
<p>During all these years, I have learned to build practical systems on the job and have
taught myself to reason about systems more formally in my own time. In this blog I would like to share
some of my thoughts on <em><strong>distributed</strong></em> systems and other <em><strong>randomness</strong></em>. Along the
way, I will also discuss papers and books. But as with any
blog post, <em>the opinions are my own</em> and therefore, take them with a grain of salt. Use the
ideas that you find helpful in your own projects or work, and leave out the rest.</p>
<p>I welcome constructive criticism and therefore, do let me know what you think.</p>
